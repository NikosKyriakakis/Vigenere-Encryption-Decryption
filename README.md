# Vigenere-Encryption-Decryption

This program takes a text file as input and line by line encrypts or decrypts it based on a given key. 
Each line, after having been processed is written to an "output" file which like the "input" file is passed as a parameter, along with the key and mode. 
The mode option should either be "encrypt" or "decrypt".
The output is always in capitals.
